1) Read the question carefully and interpret it what's written line by line rather assuming or inserting your own information.
2) Divide the question and try to perform the one related to partition first,
3) Don't disable selinux policy and check at the end of the exam that it is enabled
4) 


Start with setting up the ssh server login using alias, so that everytime you reboot you can login at one go.
1) sshkeygen -t RSA -P ""
2) ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub root@servername 
3) alias lablogin='ssh root@servername'

Update you man database using below command:
#mandb

After running a command or a whole set of commands make sure you check it. 
For example: add user -> check /etc/passwd file, 
made changes to fstab -> reboot machine, ensure partition is mounted

7. First thing in exam -> read all questions and pick all related to partitions and logical volumes first. 
If you make a mistake at beginning you will be able to revert your changes and start exam from scratch. 
If you make a mistake with partitions in middle-end of exam there will be no time to redo all tasks.
